## 2025-10-06 - Agent Refactor Complete & Merged

### What Was Done
**Merged feature/agent-refactor into feature/dimos-integration**

Successfully completed major refactor separating ROS concerns from business logic:

#### Architecture Changes
- **Created MissionExecutor** (299 lines) - Pure Python business logic
  - No ROS dependencies, fully testable
  - Direct DIMOS integration (OpenAIAgent, PlanningAgent)
  - Configurable token limits for OpenAI API
  
- **Simplified MissionAgentNode** (307 lines) - Thin ROS wrapper
  - Delegates to MissionExecutor
  - Handles ROS lifecycle, topics, services
  - Renamed `self.executor` → `self.mission_executor` to avoid ROS conflict

#### Testing Infrastructure
- Added 14 unit tests for MissionExecutor
  - 10 passing, 4 skipped (integration placeholders)
  - Runs in 0.09s without ROS dependencies
- Removed old agent wrapper tests (332 lines)

#### Documentation
- Complete rewrite of `AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Added usage examples, migration guide, troubleshooting

#### Runtime Bug Fixes (discovered during robot testing)
1. **Executor naming conflict**: ROS2 Node has reserved `executor` attribute
2. **Model parameter**: DIMOS uses `model_name=` not `model=`
3. **Token limits**: Added configuration (max_output=4096, max_input=128000)

### Validation
- ✅ Builds successfully (colcon)
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Tested on robot: 47 skills loaded
- ✅ Web interface working
- ✅ Mission execution functional

### Key Learnings
- **Runtime testing crucial**: All three bugs found during robot deployment, not unit tests
- **Parameter names matter**: Always verify API signatures when integrating libraries
- **Token limits vary**: Different models have different constraints (gpt-4o: 4096 vs 16384)
- **ROS reserved attributes**: Node.executor is used internally by rclpy

### Next Steps
See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for upcoming work.
