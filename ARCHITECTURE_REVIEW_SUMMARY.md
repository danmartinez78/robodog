# ShadowHound Architecture Review Summary
_Date: October 3, 2025_

## Changes Made

### 1. Comprehensive Architecture Design

**Problem**: Documentation was aspirational with vague boundaries and missing implementation details.

**Solution**: Created a clear four-layer architecture with explicit responsibilities:
- **Application Layer**: Launch files, configs, deployment
- **Agent Layer**: LLM/VLM orchestration, mission planning
- **Skills Layer**: Execution engine with safety guards
- **Robot Layer**: ROS2 bridge to hardware
- **Hardware Layer**: go2_ros2_sdk (external)

### 2. Concrete Package Structure

**Before**: Generic package names with unclear purposes
**After**: Five core packages with clear roles:

```
shadowhound_interfaces/   → Custom ROS2 messages/services/actions
shadowhound_robot/        → Hardware interface (go2_ros2_sdk bridge)
shadowhound_skills/       → Skills registry + implementations
shadowhound_agent/        → Mission planner + LLM integration
shadowhound_bringup/      → Launch files and configurations
```

Each package now has detailed internal structure documented.

### 3. Clear Data Flows

**Command Flow**: User → Agent → Skills → Robot → Hardware
**Feedback Flow**: Hardware → Robot → Skills → Agent → User

Both flows now explicitly documented with interfaces at each boundary.

### 4. Phase-Based Implementation Plan

**Before**: Phases marked as "complete" with no actual code
**After**: Honest status assessment and actionable phases:

- **Phase 0 (CURRENT)**: Bootstrap - Package scaffolding
- **Phase 1**: Basic Skills - Implement without hardware
- **Phase 2**: Robot Integration - Connect to Go2
- **Phase 3**: Agent Integration - Natural language missions
- **Phase 4**: Advanced Navigation - Mapping and autonomy
- **Phase 5**: Vision & Perception - VLM integration
- **Phase 6**: Onboard Deployment - Run on Jetson Thor

Each phase has specific tasks and exit criteria.

### 5. Skills API Specification

**Before**: Abstract concept without implementation guidance
**After**: Complete specification with:
- Registration pattern with decorators
- Validation requirements
- Result structure (SkillResult with data + telemetry)
- Safety requirements (timeouts, clamps, error handling)
- Code examples for implementation and usage

### 6. Robot Interface Patterns

**New**: Explicit separation between Skills and ROS topics
- Skills never publish directly to /cmd_vel
- All hardware access through RobotInterface
- Safety clamps built into interface
- State monitoring and aggregation

### 7. Updated Documentation

**Files Updated**:
1. **`docs/project.md`** (Backed up old version)
   - Complete architecture with diagrams
   - Full package structure with file listings
   - Skills API reference
   - Development workflow
   - All 6 implementation phases
   - Safety constraints and ROS topics
   - Configuration and deployment guides

2. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**
   - Phase-aware guidance
   - Code templates for skills
   - Common patterns and anti-patterns
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Testing patterns

3. **`README.md`**
   - User-focused quick start
   - Clear status (Phase 0)
   - Architecture overview
   - Development workflow
   - Skills API examples
   - Roadmap with checkboxes

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Skills-First Design
- **All robot control** goes through Skills API
- No direct ROS topic publishing from agents
- Enforces safety, validation, and telemetry

### 2. Type-Safe Interfaces
- Python type hints required
- Parameter validation before execution
- Structured result objects (not bare returns)

### 3. Safety by Default
- Every skill has timeout
- Velocity commands clamped to safe ranges
- Input validation required
- Telemetry for all operations

### 4. Layered Responsibilities
- Agent doesn't know about ROS topics
- Skills don't know about LLMs
- Robot interface doesn't know about missions
- Clear separation of concerns

### 5. Container-First Development
- All development in devcontainer
- Consistent environment across team
- Pre-configured tools and aliases

## What's Next

### Immediate (Phase 0)
1. Create `shadowhound_interfaces` package with custom messages
2. Create skeleton packages for robot, skills, agent, bringup
3. Set up basic launch files
4. Create `shadowhound.repos` for go2_ros2_sdk
5. Verify clean build: `cb` succeeds without errors

### Short Term (Phase 1)
1. Implement Skills registry and executor
2. Create 4 basic skills (say, stop, rotate, snapshot)
3. Write unit tests for all skills
4. CLI tool for testing skills

### Medium Term (Phase 2-3)
1. Import and integrate go2_ros2_sdk
2. Implement RobotInterface
3. Test skills on real hardware
4. Add LLM client and mission planner
5. Natural language mission execution

## Documentation Structure

```

├── docs/
│   └── project.md                     # Complete architecture (THIS IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH)

```

**Documentation Hierarchy**:
1. `docs/project.md` - Architecture authority
2. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Development patterns
3. `README.md` - User onboarding
4. Package READMEs - Implementation details

## Success Metrics

### Phase 0 Complete When:
- [ ] All 5 packages created with proper structure
- [ ] `cb` builds workspace without errors
- [ ] `ros2 pkg list | grep shadowhound` shows all packages
- [ ] Each package has README.md

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] Skills registry functional
- [ ] 4 basic skills implemented and tested
- [ ] Unit tests pass: `pytest src/shadowhound_skills/test/`
- [ ] Skills callable via CLI

### Overall Project Complete When:
- [ ] Demo mission works: "Find the blue ball in the kitchen"
- [ ] Natural language → navigation → perception → reporting
- [ ] Works on real Go2 hardware
- [ ] Deployable on Jetson Thor

## Feedback & Iteration

This architecture provides:
- ✅ Clear boundaries between layers
- ✅ Testable components (can test skills without hardware)
- ✅ Safe defaults (all control through validated Skills API)
- ✅ Extensible (easy to add new skills)
- ✅ Maintainable (clear responsibilities)

**Questions for team**:
1. Does the package structure make sense?
2. Are the phase priorities correct?
3. Should we add any additional safety mechanisms?
4. Any concerns about the Skills API design?
