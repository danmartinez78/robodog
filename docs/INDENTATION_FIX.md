# Indentation Fix Summary

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Commit**: `fa517f2`  
**Issue**: IndentationError preventing mission_agent from starting

---

## 🐛 Problem

```
IndentationError: expected an indented block after function definition on line 301
File: web_interface.py, line 302
```

Mission agent failed to start with:
```python
async def broadcast(self, message: str):
"""Broadcast message to all connected WebSocket clients."""
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `broadcast()` method was incorrectly indented **inside** the `_get_dashboard_html()` method instead of at class level.

**Before (WRONG - 8 spaces)**:
```python
def _get_dashboard_html(self) -> str:
    # ... code ...
    return """..."""

        async def broadcast(self, message: str):  # ← WRONG: 8 spaces (inside method)
        """Broadcast..."""
```

**After (CORRECT - 4 spaces)**:
```python
def _get_dashboard_html(self) -> str:
    # ... code ...
    return """..."""

    async def broadcast(self, message: str):  # ← CORRECT: 4 spaces (class level)
        """Broadcast..."""
```

## ✅ Solution

Changed indentation from 8 spaces to 4 spaces, making `broadcast()` a class method instead of nested inside `_get_dashboard_html()`.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/shadowhound_mission_agent/shadowhound_mission_agent/web_interface.py` (1 line)

**Commit**: `fa517f2`

## 🧪 Verification

```bash
# 1. Syntax check - PASSED
python3 -m py_compile web_interface.py
✅ No syntax errors

# 2. Build - PASSED  
colcon build --packages-select shadowhound_mission_agent
✅ Build successful

# 3. Launch test - PASSED
ros2 launch shadowhound_bringup shadowhound.launch.py
✅ Node starts without IndentationError
```

---

## 🚀 Status

**FIXED** ✅ - Mission agent now launches successfully!

You can now launch the system:
```bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch shadowhound_bringup shadowhound.launch.py
```

The indentation error is resolved and all files compile successfully.
