## 🚀 Ready to Test

Your fixes are now pushed and available on GitHub! You can:

1. **Pull on another machine**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin feature/dimos-integration
   ```

2. **Launch the system**:
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ros2 launch shadowhound_bringup shadowhound.launch.py
   ```

3. **Test multi-step commands**:
   - "rotate right and step back" should now work sequentially!
   - Web UI at http://localhost:8080 shows performance metrics

4. **Monitor performance**:
   - Check the Performance Metrics panel in web UI
   - Terminal shows timing breakdown after each command
   - PlanningAgent will show sequential execution in logs

## 📝 Next Steps

Based on the todo list:

### Immediate (Ready Now)
- [ ] Test and collect baseline performance data
  - Run commands and observe timing in web UI
  - Compare simple vs multi-step command performance
  - Document baseline metrics

### Short-term
- [ ] Analyze performance bottlenecks
  - Review collected data
  - Identify if cloud API or DIMOS is bottleneck
  
- [ ] Optimize based on findings
  - Consider gpt-3.5-turbo if cloud API is slow
  - Target: <2s simple, <5s multi-step

### Medium-term (VLM Integration)
- [ ] Integrate vision skills with mission_agent
- [ ] Register vision skills with DIMOS
- [ ] Test end-to-end vision missions
