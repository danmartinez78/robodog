# End of Day Summary: 2025-10-10

## üéØ What We Accomplished Today

### ‚úÖ Major Achievements

1. **Ollama Infrastructure Complete**
   - Jetson-optimized container running on Thor
   - Backend validation system (two-layer: start.sh + mission_agent)
   - Multiple models available (phi4, qwen2.5-coder, qwq, llama3.3, deepseek-r1)
   - API-only operations (no docker restart issues)
   - Auto-start container capability

2. **GPU Monitoring Solution Ready**
   - jtop installation scripts created and committed
   - Security analysis completed (ACCEPTABLE RISK)
   - Scripts verified against originals (line-by-line)
   - Ready to deploy on Thor tomorrow
   - Solves nvidia-smi N/A issue

3. **Model Selection: phi4:14b**
   - Primary candidate for robot testing
   - Speed: 15-20 tok/s expected (fast)
   - Quality: Strong reasoning + JSON capability
   - Size: ~7.7GB VRAM (reasonable)
   - Backup: qwen2.5-coder:32b (better JSON, slower)

4. **Documentation Package**
   - OLLAMA_STATUS_AND_TODOS.md (comprehensive status)
   - QUICK_START_ROBOT_TEST.md (tomorrow's protocol)
   - OLLAMA_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md (updated with phi4)
   - THOR_PERFORMANCE_NOTES.md (GPU degradation details)
   - SECURITY_ANALYSIS_JTOP.md (jtop security review)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Critical: GPU Performance Degradation

**Problem**: After unloading/reloading models, GPU speed drops 50-86%
```
Baseline:       36.67 tok/s  ‚úÖ
Post-benchmark: ~5 tok/s     ‚ùå (86% slower!)
```

**Impact**:
- Benchmark results unreliable
- May affect production if models are cycled
- Root cause unknown

**Workaround**:
- Reboot Thor before production use
- Keep model loaded (avoid unload/reload)
- Use `keep_alive: -1` parameter

**Next Steps**:
- Install jtop tomorrow (monitor GPU during testing)
- Test if keeping model loaded prevents issue
- Investigate CUDA persistence mode
- May need to contact NVIDIA/Ollama maintainers

**Decision**: 
- Won't block robot testing (single model, kept loaded)
- Document as known issue if merge proceeds
- Continue investigation in parallel

---

## üìä Benchmark Status: INCOMPLETE

**Attempted**: Full model benchmark with quality scoring  
**Result**: FAILED - GPU degradation invalidated results  
**Data**: Partial results, unreliable due to degradation  

**What We Know**:
- phi4:14b: Fast, good quality (preliminary observation)
- qwen2.5-coder:32b: 4-5 tok/s, excellent JSON (previous benchmark)
- GPU validation: Works when fresh, degrades after benchmark

**Next Steps**:
- Skip formal benchmark for now
- Test phi4:14b on robot (real-world validation)
- Investigate GPU issue before re-benchmarking
- May use robot performance as quality metric

## üí≠ Confidence Assessment

### üü¢ HIGH Confidence
- Ollama infrastructure (container, API, models)
- Backend validation system (working perfectly)
- phi4:14b basic capability (fast, capable)
- Documentation (comprehensive, helpful)
- jtop scripts (complete, security-reviewed)

### üü° MEDIUM Confidence
- GPU degradation (workaround available, root cause unknown)
- Production deployment (need to solve degradation for long-term)
- Benchmark quality (incomplete, need real-world validation)

### üü¢ HIGH Confidence for Tomorrow
- Robot testing will succeed (even with degradation issue)
- phi4:14b will perform well (kept loaded, no cycling)
- Can make informed merge decision after testing

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **GPU Monitoring Critical**
   - nvidia-smi inadequate on Thor (returns N/A)
   - jtop essential for accurate GPU metrics
   - Should have installed earlier in process

2. **Benchmark Complexity**
   - Model unload/reload introduces unknown variable
   - GPU state matters more than expected
   - Real-world testing may be better metric than synthetic benchmark

3. **Documentation Pays Off**
   - Comprehensive docs save time tomorrow
   - Quick start guide will streamline testing
   - Status document clarifies next steps

4. **Known Issues OK for Merge**
   - Don't need perfect solution to ship
   - Workarounds can be acceptable
   - Document and iterate

5. **Community Scripts Need Verification**
   - Line-by-line review caught missing component
   - Security analysis important for root scripts
   - User domain knowledge critical (knew about second script)
