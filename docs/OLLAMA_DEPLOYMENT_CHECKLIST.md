## Test Plan: End-to-End Robot Integration

### Phase 1: Mission Agent Startup (15 min)

#### Test 1.1: Launch Mission Agent with Ollama Backend

**On laptop** (in devcontainer):
```bash
# Launch mission agent with Ollama configuration
ros2 launch shadowhound_mission_agent mission_agent.launch.py \
    agent_backend:=ollama \
    ollama_base_url:=http://192.168.50.10:11434 \
    ollama_model:=qwen2.5-coder:32b \
    web_host:=0.0.0.0 \
    web_port:=8080
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[INFO] [mission_agent]: Starting Mission Agent with Ollama backend
[INFO] [mission_agent]: Ollama URL: http://192.168.50.10:11434
[INFO] [mission_agent]: Model: qwen2.5-coder:32b
============================================================
üîç VALIDATING LLM BACKEND CONNECTION
============================================================
Testing ollama backend...
  URL: http://192.168.50.10:11434
  Model: qwen2.5-coder:32b
  Checking Ollama service...
  ‚úÖ Ollama service responding
  ‚úÖ Model 'qwen2.5-coder:32b' available
  Sending test prompt...
  ‚úÖ Test prompt succeeded (response: 'OK')
============================================================
‚úÖ Ollama backend validation PASSED
============================================================
[INFO] [mission_agent]: MissionExecutor ready!
[INFO] [mission_agent]: Web dashboard: http://0.0.0.0:8080
[INFO] [mission_agent]: Ready to accept missions
```

**New Feature**: The mission agent now **automatically validates** the LLM backend connection on startup. If validation fails, the node exits immediately with a clear error message. See `docs/LLM_BACKEND_VALIDATION.md` for details.

**Verify**:
- [ ] Mission agent starts without errors
- [ ] **Backend validation PASSED** (automatic on startup)
- [ ] Ollama connection successful
- [ ] Model loads correctly (check first response latency)
- [ ] No timeout errors

**Troubleshooting**:
- If **validation fails**: See error message for specific issue (service unreachable, model not found, etc.)
- If connection fails: Check `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` matches Thor IP
- If model not found: Verify model pulled on Thor (`docker exec ollama ollama list`)
- If timeout: Check Thor firewall allows port 11434
- **See detailed troubleshooting**: `docs/LLM_BACKEND_VALIDATION.md`

---

#### Test 1.2: Web Dashboard Access

**On laptop browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

**Verify**:
- [ ] Dashboard loads successfully
- [ ] Backend indicator shows "OLLAMA" (not "OPENAI")
- [ ] Model name displays: "qwen2.5-coder:32b"
- [ ] Connection status: GREEN
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors

**Screenshot**: Take screenshot of dashboard showing Ollama backend active

---

### Phase 2: Simple Mission Tests (30 min)

#### Test 2.1: Text Response (No Robot Motion)

**Mission**: "Describe what you are"

**Expected LLM Response**:
- Should identify as robot assistant
- Concise response (JSON specialist, not verbose)
- Fast response (<5 seconds for qwen2.5-coder:32b at 4.4 tok/s)

**Verify**:
- [ ] Response received within 10 seconds
- [ ] Response is coherent and relevant
- [ ] No errors in mission agent logs
- [ ] Dashboard shows response correctly

**Logs to Check**:
```bash
# In separate terminal
ros2 topic echo /shadowhound/mission/status
```

---

#### Test 2.2: Navigation Plan Generation (JSON Output)

**Mission**: "Create a navigation plan to explore 3 meters forward, then rotate right"

**Expected LLM Response** (JSON structure):
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {"action": "nav.goto", "params": {"x": 3.0, "y": 0.0}},
    {"action": "nav.rotate", "params": {"yaw": -1.57}}
  ]
}
```

**Verify**:
- [ ] JSON structure is valid
- [ ] Skills are correctly identified (nav.goto, nav.rotate)
- [ ] Parameters have reasonable values
- [ ] qwen2.5-coder excels at structured output (benchmark winner)

**Compare**: Try same mission with OpenAI backend later to validate quality difference

---

#### Test 2.3: Complex Reasoning

**Mission**: "If the robot is 0.6m wide and needs to pass through a 0.8m doorway with an obstacle 0.3m to the left, should it go right or left?"

**Expected Response**:
- Logical reasoning explaining choice
- Correct answer: "Go RIGHT" (0.4m clearance vs 0.1m)
- Clear explanation

**Verify**:
- [ ] Correct reasoning
- [ ] Not overly verbose (qwq:32b was too verbose, qwen should be concise)
- [ ] Fast response (<10 seconds)

---

### Phase 3: Robot Hardware Integration (45 min)

**Prerequisites**:
- GO2 robot powered on
- ROS2 bridge active (go2_ros2_sdk running on Thor)

- Map loaded

#### Test 3.1: Simple Navigation Command

**Mission**: "Move forward 1 meter"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. LLM generates navigation plan: `{"steps": [{"action": "nav.goto", "params": {"x": 1.0, "y": 0.0}}]}`
2. Mission agent executes skill: `nav.goto`
3. Robot moves forward ~1 meter
4. Success reported back to dashboard

**Verify**:
- [ ] LLM generates correct JSON plan
- [ ] Skill execution starts (check `/cmd_vel` topic)
- [ ] Robot physically moves
- [ ] Distance approximately correct (¬±0.2m tolerance)
- [ ] Mission completes successfully
- [ ] Dashboard shows "SUCCESS" status

**Logs to Check**:
```bash
# Monitor velocity commands
ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel

# Monitor skill execution
ros2 topic echo /shadowhound/skill/status
```

---

#### Test 3.2: Multi-Step Mission

**Mission**: "Rotate 90 degrees left, move forward 2 meters, then rotate back to original heading"

**Expected Plan**:
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {"action": "nav.rotate", "params": {"yaw": 1.57}},
    {"action": "nav.goto", "params": {"x": 2.0, "y": 0.0}},
    {"action": "nav.rotate", "params": {"yaw": -1.57}}
  ]
}
```

**Verify**:
- [ ] LLM generates multi-step plan

{
  "steps": [
    {"action": "perception.snapshot", "params": {}}
  ]
}
```

**Verify**:
- [ ] LLM identifies perception skill
- [ ] Camera image captured
- [ ] Image displayed in dashboard (if implemented)
- [ ] Mission reports success

---

#### Test 3.4: Error Handling

**Mission**: "Move to an unreachable location behind a wall"

**Expected Behavior**:
- LLM generates plan (may not know about wall)
- Navigation skill attempts execution
- Nav2 reports failure (obstacle/timeout)
- Mission agent reports error to LLM
- LLM suggests alternative or acknowledges failure

**Verify**:
- [ ] System doesn't crash on navigation failure
- [ ] Error properly reported to user
- [ ] LLM provides helpful error message
- [ ] System ready for next mission

---

### Phase 4: Performance Validation (30 min)

#### Test 4.1: Response Time Benchmarks

Execute 10 simple missions and measure:

**Metrics**:
- Time to first token (TTFT)
- Total completion time
- End-to-end mission time (LLM + skill execution)

**Target Performance** (based on benchmarks):
- TTFT: <2 seconds
- Simple text response: <5 seconds
- JSON navigation plan: <8 seconds
- Quality score: >90/100 (use quality_scorer.py)

**Record Results**:
```bash
# Use benchmark script
cd scripts
./benchmark_ollama_models.sh  # Re-run with production config

# Or manual timing
time echo "Mission: move forward 1m" | ros2 topic pub --once /shadowhound/mission ...
```

**Verify**:
- [ ] Performance meets benchmarked expectations
- [ ] No degradation from Thor system load
- [ ] Consistent response times (low variance)

---

#### Test 4.2: Memory Stability

Run 20+ missions consecutively and monitor:

**On Thor**:
```bash
# Monitor container memory
watch -n 10 'docker stats ollama --no-stream'
```

**Verify**:
- [ ] Memory usage stable (~20GB for qwen2.5-coder:32b)
- [ ] No memory leaks (gradual increase)
- [ ] No OOM errors
- [ ] Model stays loaded between missions

**Expected Memory**:
- Initial: ~1GB (empty container)
- After first mission: ~20GB (model loaded)
- After 20 missions: Still ~20GB (stable)

---

#### Test 4.3: Concurrent Operation

With robot operating:
- Launch Nav2 stack
- Launch mission agent with Ollama
- Execute navigation mission
- Monitor system resources on Thor

**On Thor**:
```bash
# Check CPU, memory, GPU
htop
docker stats
nvidia-smi
```

**Verify**:
- [ ] Thor CPU usage <80%
- [ ] Memory usage comfortable (<100GB of 128GB)
- [ ] No resource contention
- [ ] All systems responsive

---

### Phase 5: Backup Model Testing (15 min)

#### Test 5.1: Fallback to phi4:14b

**Reconfigure mission agent** to use backup model:
```bash
ros2 launch shadowhound_mission_agent mission_agent.launch.py \
    agent_backend:=ollama \
    ollama_model:=phi4:14b
```

**Run same test missions**:
1. Simple text response
2. Navigation plan generation
3. Multi-step mission

**Verify**:
- [ ] phi4:14b works correctly
- [ ] Much faster responses (20.2 tok/s vs 4.4)
- [ ] Quality still acceptable (86.7/100 benchmark)
- [ ] Valid backup option if qwen2.5-coder has issues

---

### Phase 6: Comparison with OpenAI (15 min)

**Optional but Recommended**: Compare with cloud backend

#### Test 6.1: OpenAI Backend Baseline

**Launch with OpenAI**:
```bash
ros2 launch shadowhound_mission_agent mission_agent.launch.py \
    agent_backend:=openai \
    openai_model:=gpt-4-turbo
```

**Run same test missions** and compare:

| Metric | qwen2.5-coder:32b | phi4:14b | gpt-4-turbo |
|--------|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| Response Time | ~5s | ~2s | ~3s |
| JSON Quality | | | |
| Reasoning Quality | | | |
| Cost per Mission | $0 | $0 | ~$0.03 |
| Privacy | Local | Local | Cloud |

**Verify**:
- [ ] Ollama quality competitive with OpenAI
- [ ] Local response times acceptable
- [ ] No degradation in mission success rate
