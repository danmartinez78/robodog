# Camera Feed Integration - Testing Guide

## What Was Changed

Added live camera feed to the web interface so you can see what the robot sees directly in the browser.

### Changes Made

1. **mission_agent.py**:
   - Added subscription to `/camera/compressed` topic
   - Uses BEST_EFFORT QoS to match camera publisher
   - Forwards camera frames via WebSocket to web interface
   - Added `_camera_callback()` method to handle incoming frames

2. **web_interface.py**:
   - Updated WebSocket message handler to detect camera frames
   - Camera frames sent as `CAMERA_FRAME:<base64_data>`
   - JavaScript automatically displays frames in camera panel

## How to Test

### 1. Restart the Mission Agent

If you have the system running, restart it to pick up the changes:

```bash
# Kill existing agent
pkill -f mission_agent

# Or use the full restart
./start.sh --dev --skip-update
```

### 2. Check the Logs

You should see this line in the startup logs:

```
[mission_agent-1] [INFO] [timestamp] [mission_agent]: ðŸ“· Subscribed to camera feed: /camera/compressed
```

### 3. Open the Web Interface

Navigate to: http://localhost:8080

You should now see:
- Live camera feed in the camera panel (top-right)
- Updates in real-time as the robot moves
- No lag or delay (streaming directly via WebSocket)

### 4. Verify Camera Topic

Check that the camera topic is publishing:

```bash
# List camera topics
ros2 topic list | grep camera

# Check publication rate
ros2 topic hz /camera/compressed

# Echo a few frames
ros2 topic echo /camera/compressed --once
```

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Feed Not Showing

**Check 1**: Is the camera topic publishing?
```bash
ros2 topic list | grep camera
```

**Check 2**: Is the mission agent subscribed?
```bash
ros2 node info /mission_agent | grep -A 10 Subscriptions
```
Should show `/camera/compressed`

**Check 3**: Check browser console (F12)
- Look for WebSocket messages
- Should see "WebSocket connected"
- Camera frames should NOT appear in console (filtered out to reduce spam)

**Check 4**: Verify QoS compatibility
```bash
# Check camera topic QoS
ros2 topic info /camera/compressed --verbose
```
Should show BEST_EFFORT reliability

### Camera Feed is Laggy

This shouldn't happen with WebSocket streaming, but if it does:

1. **Check network**: Ensure good connection between laptop and robot
2. **Check CPU**: High CPU usage can cause frame drops
3. **Check bandwidth**: Camera resolution might be too high

### Error Messages

**"Failed to subscribe to camera"**
- sensor_msgs package might not be installed
- Run: `sudo apt install ros-humble-sensor-msgs`

**"Camera callback error"**
- Check the error count in logs
- Usually indicates format issues with camera data

## Technical Details

### Camera Stream Flow

```
Robot Camera
    â†“
/camera/compressed (CompressedImage, BEST_EFFORT QoS)
    â†“
mission_agent._camera_callback()
    â†“
base64 encode
    â†“
WebSocket: "CAMERA_FRAME:<base64>"
    â†“
web_interface JavaScript
    â†“
Display in <img> tag
```

### Performance

- **Latency**: ~50-100ms (WebSocket + encoding)
- **Frame Rate**: Matches camera publisher (typically 10-30 fps)
- **Bandwidth**: ~50-200 KB/frame (depends on compression)

### QoS Settings

Using BEST_EFFORT QoS because:
- Camera feed is real-time data (old frames are useless)
- Missing frames are acceptable
- Reduces latency
- Matches typical camera publisher settings

## Next Steps

If camera feed is working:

1. âœ… Test with robot moving around
2. âœ… Verify frame rate is acceptable
3. âœ… Check web interface responsiveness
4. âœ… Test mission execution while viewing feed

If you want to improve it:

- Add frame rate indicator
- Add "freeze frame" button
- Add full-screen camera view
- Add multiple camera support (front/rear/side)
- Add recording capability

## Commit

Changes committed as:
```

**Quick Test**: Open http://localhost:8080 and you should see the live camera feed in the top-right panel!
