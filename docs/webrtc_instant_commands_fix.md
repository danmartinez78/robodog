# WebRTC Instant Commands Fix - Session Summary

**Date:** October 5-6, 2025  
**Branch:** `fix/webrtc-instant-commands-and-progress` in dimos-unitree fork  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and ready for testing

---

## Problem Statement

WebRTC API commands worked perfectly via **CLI** (direct publish to `/webrtc_req`) but **hung indefinitely** when called through the **web UI** (via mission agent's ROSCommandQueue).

### Symptoms
- ‚úÖ CLI commands (1001, 1004, 1005, 1009, 1016, 1017) executed instantly
- ‚ùå Web UI commands never completed - queue waited forever
- ‚úÖ Nav2 skills (Move, SpinLeft, SpinRight) worked fine via web UI

### Commands Tested
- **1001** - Damp (walk mode)
- **1004** - StandUp
- **1005** - StandDown  
- **1009** - Sit ‚ú® (re-enabled)
- **1016** - Hello (wave)
- **1017** - Stretch

---

## Root Cause

The `ROSCommandQueue` in `ros_command_queue.py` had **backwards logic** for instant commands:

```python
# OLD BROKEN CODE - only waited WHILE busy
while self._is_busy_func() and (time.time() - start_time) < timeout:
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

**The Problem:**  
Instant commands execute so fast (0‚Üí1‚Üí0 progress in ~100ms) that by the time the queue checked `_is_busy_func()`, the robot was already back to idle. The queue thought the command never started and waited forever.

### Progress State Transitions
```
Command sent ‚Üí Robot state changes: 0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 0 (in milliseconds)
                                     ‚Üë   ‚Üë   ‚Üë
                                  IDLE BUSY IDLE
```

The queue checked after the transition completed, saw `progress=0`, and thought "not busy yet, keep waiting."

---

## The Fix

Modified `ros_command_queue.py` to **wait FOR the robot to become busy first**, then wait for completion:

```python
# NEW WORKING CODE - wait FOR busy state, then wait for completion
wait_for_busy_timeout = 2.0
became_busy = False

# Phase 1: Wait up to 2s for robot to become busy
while not self._is_busy_func() and (time.time() - start_time) < wait_for_busy_timeout:
    time.sleep(0.05)  # Check every 50ms
    if self._is_busy_func():
        became_busy = True
        break

if not became_busy:
    # Instant command - already complete by the time we checked
    self._logger.info("Command appears to be instant or already complete")
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Brief stabilization delay
    return True

# Phase 2: Now wait for completion (progress returns to 0)
while self._is_busy_func() and (time.time() - start_time) < timeout:
    time.sleep(0.1)
    
return True  # Success
```

### Additional Changes

**`unitree_ros_control.py`** - Simplified state detection:
```python
# OLD: Complex mode+progress logic
if progress == 0 and mode == 1:
    self._mode = RobotMode.IDLE
elif progress == 1 or mode != 1:
    self._mode = RobotMode.MOVING

# NEW: Use progress only (more reliable)
if progress == 0:
    self._mode = RobotMode.IDLE
elif progress == 1:
    self._mode = RobotMode.MOVING
```

**`unitree_skills.py`**:
- Re-enabled Sit command (ID 1009)
- Minor formatting improvements

## Changes Made

### Commits in `dimos-unitree` fork (fix/webrtc-instant-commands-and-progress):

1. **7538e0f** - Fix WebRTC command queue for instant commands  
   - Modified: `ros_command_queue.py`, `unitree_ros_control.py`, `unitree_skills.py`
   - **The Core Fix** ‚ú®

2. **27d2ea2** - Fix: Use go2_interfaces.msg instead of unitree_go.msg  
   - Fixed import error in `unitree_ros_control.py`

3. **3c0bc01** - Revert go2_ros2_sdk to 6c0551b (restore working state)  
   - Reverted unnecessary submodule update that crossed a rebase

4. **4addfbc** - Skip models directory during build (requires PyTorch/CUDA)  
   - Added `COLCON_IGNORE` to `dimos/models/` directory
   - Avoids build failures from Detic vision models that need ML dependencies

### Updated in `shadowhound` repo:

**`shadowhound.repos`**:
```yaml
repositories:
  dimos-unitree:
    type: git
    url: https://github.com/danmartinez78/dimos-unitree.git
    version: fix/webrtc-instant-commands-and-progress
```

## Current State

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Queue fix implemented and tested via CLI
- Import errors resolved
- Build issues fixed (submodule reverted, models skipped)
- All changes pushed to `fix/webrtc-instant-commands-and-progress` branch
- `shadowhound.repos` updated to point to fix branch
- Clean build verified in devcontainer

### ‚è≥ Ready for Testing
- **Need to test via Web UI on laptop** to confirm the fix works end-to-end
- Commands should now work through mission agent when called from web interface

### üéØ Test Commands (via Web UI)
```
"sit"
"stand up"
"wave hello"
"stretch"
"damp"
```

---

## Deployment Instructions

### On Laptop (or any machine with the robot):

```bash
cd ~/shadowhound/src/dimos-unitree
git pull
git submodule update --recursive

cd ~/shadowhound
rm -rf build install log
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash

# Launch the stack
ros2 launch shadowhound_bringup shadowhound_bringup.launch.py
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Web UI commands should execute immediately** (no more hanging)
2. **Agent should receive success/failure responses** within 2-3 seconds
3. **Progress state transitions visible** in logs:
   ```
   [INFO] Executing WebRTC command: 1009
   [INFO] Waiting for robot to become busy...
   [INFO] Robot became busy (progress=1)
   [INFO] Waiting for completion...
   [INFO] Command complete (progress=0)
   ```

## Technical Details

### Robot State Topics
- **`/go2_states`** - Published by `go2_driver_node`
  - `progress`: 0 (idle), 1 (executing)
  - `mode`: 1 (normal), others (unknown)
  
### Command Flow
```
Web UI ‚Üí Mission Agent ‚Üí ROSCommandQueue ‚Üí /webrtc_req ‚Üí go2_driver_node ‚Üí Robot
         ‚Üë                     ‚Üì
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ success/failure ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Why CLI Works But Web UI Didn't
- **CLI**: Direct publish to `/webrtc_req`, no waiting
- **Web UI**: Goes through queue which needs to monitor completion
- **Queue bug**: Missed the instant state transition

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No VLM integration yet** - Commands are still hardcoded skill IDs
2. **No pose feedback** - Can't verify if commands achieved desired result
3. **2-second busy detection timeout** - Might be too long for some use cases

### Not Tested Yet
- ‚ùì Actual web UI execution (only tested via CLI so far)
- ‚ùì Error handling for failed commands
- ‚ùì Multiple rapid commands in sequence
- ‚ùì Command interruption/cancellation

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Priority 1)
1. **Test via Web UI on laptop** ‚ö°
   - Deploy the fix
   - Try "sit", "hello", "stretch" via web interface
   - Verify queue no longer hangs
   - Check logs for proper state transitions

2. **Validate error handling**
   - Test invalid command IDs
   - Test commands during motion (busy state)
   - Verify timeout behavior

### Short Term (Priority 2)
3. **Add telemetry/logging**
   - Log execution time per command
   - Track success/failure rates
   - Monitor state transitions

4. **Create PR to upstream dimos-unitree**
   - Clean up commit history (squash if needed)
   - Write proper PR description
   - Include before/after behavior

### Medium Term (Priority 3)
5. **VLM Integration**
   - Use vision to verify command completion
   - "Did the robot actually sit?"
   - Retry logic based on visual feedback

6. **Pose Estimation**
   - Parse actual robot pose from state messages
   - Validate position after navigation commands
   - Detect falls or stuck states

7. **Mission Planning**
   - Chain multiple commands
   - Handle dependencies (must stand before walking)
   - Recovery behaviors

## Environment Details

- **Robot:** Unitree Go2 (Firmware 1.1.3)
- **Network:** WebRTC mode via hotspot (192.168.12.1)
- **ROS2:** Humble
- **Development:** VS Code devcontainer
- **Repository Structure:** vcstool-managed (not git submodules)

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check timing assumptions** - "Instant" means microseconds, not zero time
2. **State machines need proper phase detection** - Wait FOR state change, not just DURING
3. **Submodule updates are risky** - Only update when necessary, verify compatibility
4. **COLCON_IGNORE is your friend** - Skip unneeded packages to avoid dependency hell
5. **CLI vs Queue behavior differs** - Direct publish != queue-mediated execution

---

## Questions for Next Session

1. Does the fix work via web UI? (Critical validation)
2. Should we add a "became_busy" flag to telemetry?
3. What's the right busy detection timeout? (currently 2s)
4. Should instant commands have a different timeout than motion commands?
5. Do we need to handle rapid command sequences specially?

---

**Status:** Ready for web UI testing. The fix is deployed and builds cleanly. Next step is validation on the actual robot through the web interface. üöÄ
